  "summary": "Most frontend requirements are implemented: a single-page responsive marketing layout with Hero/Services/About/Contact sections, consistent warm (non-blue/purple) theme tokens, contact details shown in header/footer/contact, an inquiry form with inline validation and success state, and frontend references to generated logo/hero images. Backend supports inquiry persistence and timestamps but lacks the requested basic input checks. Some extra, unrequested features (Internet Identity integration and footer attribution/UTM tracking) appear to have been added.",
